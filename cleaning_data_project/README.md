## Process followed to get and clean Sansumg data set

This file describes how run_analysis.R script works.

## Step 1: Fetch and unzip data set obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and rename the folder with "UCI HAR Dataset".

## Step 2: Verify that the script "run_analysis.R" is located in the same folder as "UCI HAR Dataset" folder, and that both are in the current working directory.

## Step 3: Run the script "run_analysis.R" in R (at this point you may have done this in RStudio).

## Step 4: Once the code was run, it wil output two text files: "Merged_data.txt" (7.9 kb) to comply with Requirement 4, and "means_data.txt" (220 Kb). The later is the file required for the asignment.
